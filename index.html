				<section data-background="./images/kirkbylonsdale.png" data-background-position="bottom">
				<h2 style="color:black">Who is this person?</h2>
				<p>Maths &rarr; Underwater Archaeology &rarr; Land Archaeology &rarr; Astun Technology &equals; No qualifications in GIS!</p>
				<p style="color:black">I'm a consultant and metadata lead at Astun Technology. I studied Mathematics at the University of Durham, then Underwater Archaeology at the University of St Andrews, worked as a land archaeologist with Oxford Archaeology for 10 years, and then joined Astun Technology 6 years ago.</p></section>
				
				<section>
				<p>Astun are a small firm, with 20 staff. We're based in Epsom but have staff spread across the UK and abroad.</p>

				<h2>iShare Maps and GIS</h2>
				<p>Our primary product is a web-based GIS solution for local authorities, based on open source software. See <a href="http://mydistrict.chichester.gov.uk/mycdc.aspx" target="_blank">My Chichester</a> and <a href="http://mywycombe.wycombe.gov.uk/mywycombe.aspx" target="_blank">My Wycombe</a> for examples</p>
				<aside class="notes">Our suite of products is used by more than 30 local authorities (district and county), as well as emergency services, and housing associations</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Metadata Management</h2>
				<p>We also provide metadata solutions to allow local authorities meet their INSPIRE requirements, and <a href="https://www.spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home" target="_blank">complete metadata portals</a> for larger clients.</p></section>

				</section>
				
				<section data-background="./images/hackathon.png" data-background-position="top">
				<p style="color:black">We also do bespoke work, training, hackathons, and conferences</p></section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>What packages do we use?</h2>
				The main packages are PostgreSQL and PostGIS, OpenLayers, Mapserver, Geonetwork and OGR</p>
				<p class="fragment">We also use QGIS, Leaflet, Geoserver, Java and <b>lots</b> of Python</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>We contribute back by committing bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation to all the projects we use.</p>
					<p class="fragment">We also sponsor the development of new features, help organising conferences and so on</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>But how do we make money?</h2>
				<p>Our products are all based on open source, which is free, so where's the catch?</p></section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>Fact: Open source is not about money</h2>
				
				Open source is purely about <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">not restricting access to the source code</a>, preserving the author's integrity, and not discriminating against people, or specific use-cases. There's no limitation on charging for development of solutions based on that code</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>Adding Value</h2>
				<p>As long as you provide the source code of the core software under it's original license you can charge for development, installation, consultancy, training, maintenance... </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Confession</h2>
					<p>We don't do everything with open source</p>
					<p class="fragment">We use Google for email, Amazon for our virtual servers, and even pay for software sometimes!</p>
					<p class="fragment">Our ethos is that open is best, but you have to be pragmatic...</p>
				</section>
				

				<section>
				<h2>Question: What is a typical day like working in Open Source?</h2>
				<img class="center" src="./images/question.png" alt="twitter question" width="400">
				</section>
				
				<section> 
					<h2>Answer(s)</h2>
					<img class="center" src="./images/wordcloud.png" alt="twitter answers" width="1200">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>We spend a lot of time wrangling data from clients, generally scripting using python and SQL...</p>
					<p class="fragment">...but we also have to understand design, testing, and project management</p>
				</section>
				
				
				
				<section><h2>What's important?</h2></section>
				
				<section>Scripting! If you are going to repeat something, write a script to do it</section>
				
				<section data-background="./images/repos.png">Version control! Repositories and concise, well-written commit messages are your saviour</section>
				
				<section>Documentation! Everything must be recorded because you might not be the next person to work on the project</section>
				
				<section>Management! Learn to manage yourself, your time, and the tasks on your project. Know when you are going "out of scope"</section>
				
				<section>The command prompt! Essential for communicating with remote servers, running low-level tools, and often so much quicker than a GUI</section>
				
				<section>What's not that important?</section>
				
				<section>Being an expert about this one thing! A wide skillset is more useful than a narrow one</section>
				
				<section>How have things changed over time?</section>
				
				<section>This is the 7th iteration of this talk and I probably do less "real GIS" than I did to start with</section>
				
				<section>Much more of what we do is around providing services, that can be designed and deployed once to multiple customers</section>
