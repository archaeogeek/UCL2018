					<h2>What do I mean when I talk about working with "Open Source"?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Companies built on Open Source software?</p>
					<p class="fragment">Yes, but also...</p>

				</section>
				

				<section>
				<h2>Building a company around Open Source software</h2>
				<p>Astun Technology's primary product is a web-based GIS solution for local authorities, based on open source software. See <a href="http://mydistrict.chichester.gov.uk/mycdc.aspx" target="_blank">My Chichester</a> as an example.</p>
				<aside class="notes">Our suite of products is used by more than 30 local authorities (district and county), as well as emergency services, and housing associations</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="./images/mychichester.png" data-background-position="top">
				</section>

				
				<section>
				<h2>Metadata Management</h2>
				<p>We also provide metadata solutions to allow local authorities meet their INSPIRE requirements, and <a href="https://www.spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home" target="_blank">complete metadata portals</a> for larger clients.</p></section>

				<section data-background="./images/ssdi.png" data-background-position="top">
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="./images/hackathon.png" data-background-position="top">
				<p style="color:black">We also do bespoke work, training, hackathons, and conferences</p></section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>What packages do we use?</h2>
				<p>Our product suite is built around PostgreSQL and PostGIS, OpenLayers, Mapserver, and OGR. We also work with Geonetwork, QGIS, Leaflet, Geoserver, Java, and use <b>lots</b> of Python</p>
				<img class="center" src="./images/Mentoring_New_1.jpg" alt="Software" width="400">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>We contribute back by committing bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation to <b>all</b> the projects we use.</p>
					<p class="fragment">We also sponsor the development of new features, help organising conferences, and so on</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>But how do we make money?</h2>
				<p>Our products are all based on open source, which is free, so where's the catch?</p></section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>Fact: Open source is not about money</h2>
				<p>Open source is purely about <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">not restricting access to the source code</a>, preserving the author's integrity, and not discriminating against people, or specific use-cases. There's no limitation on charging for development of solutions based on that code</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>Adding Value</h2>
				<p>As long as you provide the source code of the core software under it's original license you can charge for development, installation, consultancy, training, maintenance... </p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Confession</h2>
				<p>We don't do everything with open source</p>
				<p class="fragment">We use Google for email, Amazon for our virtual servers, and even pay for software sometimes!</p>
				<p class="fragment">Our ethos is that open is best, but if a paid-for solution works and doesn't restrict us then that's fine!</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="./images/employment.jpg">
				<h2>Using Open Source in your day to day work</h2>
				<p>The open source mindset is lightweight and innovative by necessity</p>
				<p class="fragment">Teach yourself to work in the same way</p>
				<aside class="notes">Open source technology enables continuous innovation, as it is built by a community of developers who are passionate about software development. In an open source community, developers never stop looking for ways to make their software better. They quickly deploy new, innovative features and will hold each other in check through continuous inspection. Their collaborative mindset leads to more effective technologies that are better positioned to evolve with emerging concepts.</aside>

				<section>
				<h2>Avoid "lock-in"</h2>
				<p>This applies to both software <b>and</b> skills</p>
				<img class="center" src="./images/flexible.png" alt="perl and idl">
				</section>


				<section>
				<h2>Aim for continuous improvement</h2>
				<p>Constantly look for opportunities to learn something new and/or get better</p>
				<p class="fragment">This will stop you getting bored for a start!</p>
				<img class="center" src="./images/always_be_improving.png" alt="My desk">
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>Ask difficult questions</h2>
				<p>Because something has been done the same way for decades doesn't mean it's the best way now</p>
				<p class="fragment">Similarly, don't rely on what you learnt at Uni!</p>
				</section>
				
				<section><h2>Top Tips</h2></section>
				
				<section>Scripting! If you are going to repeat something, write a script to do it</section>
				
				<section data-background="./images/repos.png">Version control! Repositories and concise, well-written commit messages are your saviour</section>
				
				<section>Documentation! Everything must be recorded because you might not be the next person to work on the project</section>
				
				<section>Management! Learn to manage yourself, your time, and the tasks on your project. Know when you are going "out of scope"</section>
				
				<section>The command prompt! Essential for communicating with remote servers, running low-level tools, and often so much quicker than a GUI</section>
				
				<section>What's not that important?</section>
				
				<section>Being an expert about this one thing! A wide skillset is more useful than a narrow one</section>
				
				<section>How have things changed over time?</section>
				
				<section>This is the 7th iteration of this talk and I probably do less "real GIS" than I did to start with</section>
				
				<section>Much more of what we do is around providing services, that can be designed and deployed once to multiple customers</section>
