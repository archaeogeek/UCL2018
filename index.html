				<h2 style="color:black">But how do we make money?</h2>
				<p style="color:black" class="fragment">Our products are all based on open source, which is free, so where's the catch?</p>

				<section>
				<h2>Fact: Open source is not about money</h2>
				<p>Open source is purely about <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">not restricting access to the source code</a>, preserving the author's integrity, and not discriminating against people, or specific use-cases. There's no limitation on charging for development of solutions based on that code</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>Fact: Open source is not even free</h2>
				<p>As long as you provide the source code of the core software under it's original license, you can, <b>and should</b>, charge for adding value, such as development, installation, consultancy, training, maintenance... </p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Confession</h2>
				<p class="fragment">We don't do everything with open source</p>
				<p class="fragment">We use Google for email, Amazon for our virtual servers, and even pay for software sometimes!</p>
				<p class="fragment">We prefer open, but if a paid-for solution is the best and doesn't restrict us then that's fine!</p>

				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black">Using Open Source in your day to day work</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>The open source mindset is lightweight and innovative by necessity</h2>
				<p class="fragment">Teach yourself to work in the same way</p>
				<p class="fragment">Learn to be flexible and open to new opportunities or technologies</p>
				<aside class="notes">Open source technology enables continuous innovation, as it is built by a community of developers who are passionate about software development. In an open source community, developers never stop looking for ways to make their software better. They quickly deploy new, innovative features and will hold each other in check through continuous inspection. Their collaborative mindset leads to more effective technologies that are better positioned to evolve with emerging concepts.</aside>

				<h2>Avoid "lock-in"</h2>
				<p>This applies to both software <b>and</b> skills</p>
				<img class="center" src="./images/flexible.png" alt="perl and idl">

				<section>
				<h2>Aim for continuous improvement</h2>
				<p>Constantly look for opportunities to learn something new and/or get better</p>
				<p class="fragment">This will stop you getting bored for a start!</p>

				<h2 style="color:black" class="fragment">Ask difficult questions</h2>
				<p style="color:black" class="fragment">Because something has been done the same way for decades doesn't mean it's the best way now</p>
				<p style="color:black" class="fragment">Similarly, don't rely solely on what you learnt at Uni!</p>

				<section data-background="./images/repos.png"><h2>Version control! not just for code</h2></section>
				
				<section>Documentation! Everything must be recorded because you might not be the next person to work on the project</section>
				
				<section>Management! Learn to manage yourself, your time, and the tasks on your project. Know when you are going "out of scope"</section>
				
				<section>The command prompt! Essential for communicating with remote servers, running low-level tools, and often so much quicker than a GUI</section>
